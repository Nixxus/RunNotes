# RunNotes
Speedrun Notes application

RunNotes will attempt to give Speedrunners the simple notes program they always wanted, something that shows the notes for the current split, but otherwise jumps out of the way and lets the runner focus on thier game.

RunNotes came to be as I was not satisfied with the currently available Speedrun based notes viewers.
Most clunky in design and unable to show notes containing line breaks.

RunNotes aims to be lightweight, portable and all the other programming mumbojumbo but focuses around these features:
-Simple to use
-Quick and simple to set up
-have no minimum or maximum window size
-Compatible with DirectInput and XInput controllers, so runners can change notes without having to reach for the keyboard
